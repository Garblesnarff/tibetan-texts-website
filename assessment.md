# Tibetan Texts Grove Assessment

## Project Overview

The Tibetan Texts Grove project is a database-driven website for organizing, visualizing, and providing access to Tibetan texts and their translations. It appears to be a companion or extension to the Tibetan Translation App, focusing more on the relationships between texts, teachers, and lineages in Tibetan Buddhist traditions.

## Key Features

- **Network Visualization:** The project has capabilities for visualizing relationships between teachers and lineages.
- **Category System:** Texts are organized into categories.
- **Browsing Interface:** The project has a basic interface for navigating the text collection.
- **Text Display:** The project can display Tibetan texts and their translations.
- **Supabase Integration:** The project uses Supabase for its backend database and storage infrastructure.

## Key Technologies

- **React:** A popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Vite:** A fast build tool and development server.
- **TypeScript:** A statically typed superset of JavaScript.
- **shadcn-ui:** A collection of UI components for React.
- **Tailwind CSS:** A utility-first CSS framework.
- **Supabase:** A backend-as-a-service platform.
- **vis-network or d3:** The project likely uses a visualization library like vis-network or d3 for its network visualizations.

## Project Structure

The project is a standard Vite/React application. The main application logic is located in the `src` directory. The `public` directory contains static assets, and the `node_modules` directory contains the project's dependencies. The project also has a `supabase` directory, which contains the Supabase configuration.

## Development and Deployment

The project can be developed locally by cloning the repository, installing dependencies with `npm i`, and running the development server with `npm run dev`. The README also provides instructions for deploying the project using the Lovable platform.

## Assessment

The Tibetan Texts Grove project is a complex and ambitious project that aims to create a comprehensive digital library of Tibetan texts. The project is well-structured and uses a modern technology stack. The existing project assessment provides a good overview of the project's goals and potential features. The project is in a mid-development stage, with a solid foundation and a clear path for future improvements.
