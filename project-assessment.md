## Project Overview

The Tibetan Texts Grove project is a database-driven website for organizing, visualizing, and providing access to Tibetan texts and their translations. It appears to be a companion or extension to the Tibetan Translation App, focusing more on the relationships between texts, teachers, and lineages in Tibetan Buddhist traditions.

### Core Purpose

This project aims to create a comprehensive, interconnected digital library of Tibetan texts that preserves the relational context of these works - connecting texts to their authors, lineages, traditions, and related works. This contextual approach helps researchers, practitioners, and students understand texts within their broader cultural and historical frameworks.

### Target Audience

- Scholars and academics in Tibetan studies and Buddhism
- Practitioners seeking to understand the relationships between texts
- Libraries and institutions maintaining collections of Tibetan literature
- Students learning about Tibetan Buddhist traditions and lineages

## Current State Assessment

### Implemented Features

- **Network Visualization:** Capabilities for visualizing relationships between teachers and lineages
- **Category System:** Organization of texts into categories
- **Basic Browsing Interface:** Navigation through the text collection
- **Text Display:** Viewing of Tibetan texts and translations
- **Supabase Integration:** Backend database and storage infrastructure

### Technical Foundation

- **Frontend:** Likely React with visualization libraries (vis-network, d3)
- **Backend:** Supabase for database and storage
- **Data Structure:** Models for texts, teachers, lineages, and their relationships
- **Search:** Basic search functionality for texts and teachers

### Development Stage

The project appears to be in a **mid-development stage**. While core components exist, there is likely significant work needed to create a cohesive, user-friendly experience and fully implement all planned features.

## Path to MVP

### Critical Missing Features

1. **Comprehensive Text Metadata:** Complete metadata for texts including dates, traditions, languages
2. **Relationship Management:** Enhanced tools for managing connections between texts, authors, and lineages
3. **Improved Visualization Tools:** More intuitive interfaces for exploring text relationships
4. **User Guidance:** Onboarding experience and navigation help
5. **Data Completeness:** Sufficient corpus of texts and relationships to demonstrate value

### Technical Debt to Address

1. **Data Model Refinement:** Ensure database structure properly represents complex relationships
2. **Performance Optimization:** Improve loading times for visualizations and large texts
3. **Consistency in UI:** Standardize interface elements and user flows
4. **Error Handling:** Add robust error management for data loading and processing

### Effort Estimation

Reaching MVP would require **6-8 weeks** of focused development work, with priorities on:

- Refining data models and relationships (2 weeks)
- Enhancing visualization tools (2 weeks)
- Improving search and browsing interfaces (1 week)
- Creating user guidance and documentation (1 week)
- Testing and refinement (1-2 weeks)

## Action Plan

### Immediate Next Steps

1. **Data Structure Enhancement:**
   - Review and refine database schema to support all needed relationships
   - Implement improved metadata model for texts
   - Create data validation and integrity checks

2. **Visualization Improvements:**
   - Optimize network visualization performance
   - Add filtering and focus tools for large networks
   - Implement intuitive navigation controls
   - Add contextual information display

3. **User Experience:**
   - Design and implement user onboarding flow
   - Create help documentation for complex features
   - Improve feedback for search and browsing
   - Add loading indicators and error messages

### Content Development

- Develop strategy for initial content population
- Create templates for adding new texts and relationships
- Identify priority texts for inclusion in MVP
- Establish quality standards for text metadata

### Testing Requirements

- Performance testing for visualizations with large datasets
- Usability testing for navigation and discovery
- Content accuracy verification
- Cross-browser and responsive design testing

## Long-Term Vision

After reaching MVP, potential enhancements could include:

1. **Advanced Visualization Tools:** Timeline views, geographical mapping, tradition trees
2. **Collaborative Features:** Expert contributions, annotations, and discussions
3. **Integration with Translation Tools:** Direct connection to translation workflows
4. **Public API:** Allowing other applications to access the knowledge base
5. **Personalization:** User accounts with saved views, notes, and preferences

## Resource Requirements

- **Development Time:** 6-8 weeks for MVP (part-time)
- **Data Entry:** Time for content development and relationship mapping
- **Expert Input:** Consultation with Tibetan scholars for data model validation
- **Hosting Infrastructure:** Database and storage scaling as content grows

## Integration with Other Projects

This project appears to complement the Tibetan Translation App. Potential integration points include:

- Shared authentication system
- Cross-referencing of texts between platforms
- Unified search across both platforms
- Complementary user experiences (reading vs. exploration)

The Tibetan Texts Grove project has significant potential to create a uniquely valuable resource by focusing on the relationships and contexts of Tibetan texts. By addressing the identified gaps and implementing the suggested improvements, the project can reach a viable MVP that demonstrates this value proposition to users.
